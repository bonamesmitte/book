      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        One of the best-known works of Victorian literature, its narrative,
        structure, characters and imagery have had huge influence on popular
        culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.[1][2] The book
        has never been out of print and has been translated into 174 languages.
        Its legacy covers adaptations for screen, radio, art, ballet, opera,
        musicals, theme parks, board games and video games.[3] Carroll published
        a sequel in 1871 entitled Through the Looking-Glass and a shortened
        version for young children, The Nursery "Alice", in 1890.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Chapter One – Down the Rabbit Hole:</b> Alice, a seven-year-old girl,
        is feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her
        elder sister. She notices a talking, clothed white rabbit with a pocket
        watch run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly
        falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes.
        She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but
        through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle
        on a table labelled "DRINK ME," the contents of which cause her to
        shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She
        subsequently eats a cake labelled "EAT ME" in currants as the chapter
        closes.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Two – The Pool of Tears:</b> The chapter opens with Alice
        growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling.
        Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway.
        Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through
        her own tears and meets a mouse, who is swimming as well. Alice,
        thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in
        elementary French. Her opening gambit "Où est ma chatte?"
        (transl. "Where is my cat?"), however, offends the mouse, who then tries
        to escape her.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Three – The Caucus Race and a Long Tale:</b> The sea of tears
        becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away
        by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank
        and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a
        very dry lecture on William the Conqueror. A dodo decides that the best
        thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone
        running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all
        the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately
        ferocious) cat.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Four – The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill:</b> White Rabbit
        appears again in search of the Duchess's gloves and fan. Mistaking her
        for his maidservant, Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house
        and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and
        drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified
        Rabbit orders his gardener, Bill the Lizard, to climb on the roof and go
        down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have
        gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which
        turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in
        size.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Five – Advice from a Caterpillar:</b> Alice comes upon a
        mushroom and sitting on it is a blue caterpillar smoking a hookah.
        Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity
        crisis, compounded by her inability to remember a poem. Before crawling
        away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will
        make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off
        two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than
        ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a
        pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings
        herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and
        uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Six – Pig and Pepper:</b> A fish-footman has an invitation
        for the Duchess of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice
        observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the
        frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes
        and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the
        Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning Cheshire Cat) to
        sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's
        surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree,
        directing her to the March Hare's house. He disappears but his grin
        remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark
        that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a
        cat.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Seven – A Mad Tea-Party:</b>Alice becomes a guest at a "mad"
        tea party along with the March Hare, the Hatter, and a very tired
        Dormouse, who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened
        moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give
        Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous "why is a raven
        like a writing desk?." The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day
        because Time has punished him by eternally standing still at 6 PM (tea
        time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles
        and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had
        ever been to.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Eight – The Queen's Croquet Ground:</b> Alice leaves the tea
        party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing
        cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because The Queen of
        Hearts hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens
        and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King
        and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her
        signature phrase "Off with his head!" which she utters at the slightest
        dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say
        ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her
        subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are
        used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the
        Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded,
        only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the
        head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the
        Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to
        resolve the matter.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Nine – The Mock Turtle's Story:</b> The Duchess is brought to
        the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals
        in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the
        threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the Gryphon, who takes
        her to the Mock Turtle. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has
        no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real
        turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a
        game.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Ten – Lobster Quadrille:</b> The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon
        dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly)
        "'Tis the Voice of the Lobster". The Mock Turtle sings them "Beautiful
        Soup" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending
        trial.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Eleven – Who Stole the Tarts?:</b> Alice attends a trial
        whereby the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts.
        The jury is composed of various animals, including Bill the Lizard, the
        White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the King of
        Hearts. During the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing
        larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow
        at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the
        dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot
        help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who
        displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the
        questioning, and the Duchess's cook.<br /><br />

        <b>Chapter Twelve – Alice's Evidence:</b> Alice is then called up as a
        witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals
        inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their
        seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be
        gone, citing Rule 42 ("All persons more than a mile high to leave the
        court"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She
        argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous
        proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, "It's
        not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place", in the
        process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit
        responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons
        the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, "Off with her head!",
        but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice
        holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to
        swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing
        what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from
        Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the
        curious happenings for herself.
